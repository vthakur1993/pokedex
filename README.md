## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern, leveraging Android Architecture Components to create a robust and maintainable codebase. The architecture promotes separation of concerns and testability.

*   **View (UI Layer):**
    *   Built entirely with **Jetpack Compose** for a declarative and modern UI.
    *   Observes state changes from the ViewModel (`StateFlow`) and forwards user interactions.
    *   Consists of Composable functions, Activities.
*   **ViewModel (`PokedexViewmodel`):**
    *   Holds and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
    *   Exposes UI state using `kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow`.
    *   Handles user interactions and delegates business logic to the Repository.
    *   Uses `viewModelScope` for coroutine operations.
*   **Repository (`PokedexRepository`, `PokedexNetworkRepository`):**
    *   Single source of truth for data.
    *   Abstracts data sources (network, local database).
    *   Decides whether to fetch data from the network or local cache.
    *   Handles data mapping between network DTOs and database entities/domain models.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Remote (`PokedexNetworkRepository`):**
        *   Uses **Retrofit** for making HTTP requests to the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
        *   Uses **Gson/Moshi** for JSON parsing (TODO: Specify which one you used).
    *   **Local (`PokemonDao`):**
        *   Uses **Room Persistence Library** for storing and retrieving Pokemon data locally.
        *   Provides offline support.
*   **Dependency Injection:**
    *   **Hilt** is used for managing dependencies throughout the application, simplifying boilerplate and improving testability.
*   **Coroutines & Flow:**
    *   Asynchronous operations are handled using **Kotlin Coroutines**.
    *   **Kotlin Flow** is used for reactive data streams from the repository to the ViewModel and for handling sequences of data (like paginated API responses).

## üß™ Testing

Ensuring the reliability and correctness of the Pokedex app is a top priority. The project includes:

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Located in `src/test/java/com/example/pokedex/`.
    *   Focus on testing individual components in isolation, primarily ViewModels and Repositories.
    *   **Mockito-Kotlin** is used for mocking dependencies.
    *   **Turbine** is used to test `Flow` emissions thoroughly.
    *   `kotlinx-coroutines-test` is used for managing test dispatchers and testing coroutines.
*   **Instrumentation (UI) Tests:**
    *   Located in `src/androidTest/java/com.example/pokedex/`.
    *   Focus on testing UI interactions and verifying screen states using **Jetpack Compose testing APIs**.
    *   **Hilt Android Testing** is used to provide test dependencies and manage the component lifecycle in UI tests.
    *   (TODO: Add specific examples of UI tests if you have them, e.g., "Tests navigation between list and detail screens.")

**How to Run Tests:**

1.  **Unit Tests:**: bash ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
Or run them directly from Android Studio (right-click on the test class/method).
2.  **Instrumentation (UI) Tests:**
bash ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
Requires a connected device or emulator. Or run them from Android Studio.
